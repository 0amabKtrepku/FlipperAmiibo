This pack includes a new map called Safe Haven, which is the largest map in Survivor Mode. It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic called Salvage Mode, where you have to collect resources and items to survive.
- Lost Contact: Play as Axel, the survivor who helped Amanda at the beginning of the game. He tries to find his friends and escape from Sevastopol. This pack includes four new maps: Contact, Gemini Systems, The Bacchus Apartments, and The Outpost.
